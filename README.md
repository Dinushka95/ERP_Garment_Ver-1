# ERP_Garment_Ver-1

It was done as our second-year university project for information technology project, as you can see it was computerizing the manual process of a garment process. The main problem they face is they had few production factories at different places and they wanted information / data available at every factory and as quick as possible.<br/>

So we centralized the information, making it available to everybody. <br/>

It is java windows form application developed, by a team of 8 students.
